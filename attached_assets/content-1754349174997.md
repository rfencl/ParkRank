Interactive map (possibly incomplete) of the National Parks of the United States.

The [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") has 63 [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park "National park"), which are [congressionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") designated [protected areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area "Protected area") operated by the [National Park Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service "National Park Service"), an agency of the [Department of the Interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior "United States Department of the Interior").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-NPSAboutus-1) National parks are designated for their natural beauty, unique geological features, diverse ecosystems, and recreational opportunities, typically "because of some outstanding scenic feature or natural phenomena."[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-2) While legislatively all [units of the National Park System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_United_States_National_Park_System_official_units "List of the United States National Park System official units") are considered equal with the same mission, national parks are generally larger and more of a destination, and hunting and extractive activities are prohibited.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-3) [National monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_monuments_of_the_United_States "List of national monuments of the United States"), on the other hand, are also frequently protected for their historical or archaeological significance. Eight national parks (including six in [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")) are paired with a [national preserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_preserve "National preserve"), areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_United_States_National_Park_System_official_units "List of the United States National Park System official units") and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 433 units of the [National Park System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_in_the_United_States_National_Park_System "List of areas in the United States National Park System") can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-4)

A bill creating the first national park, [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park "Yellowstone National Park"), was signed into law by President [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant "Ulysses S. Grant") in 1872, followed by [Mackinac National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackinac_National_Park "Mackinac National Park") in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then [Rock Creek Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Creek_Park "Rock Creek Park") (later merged into [National Capital Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Parks "National Capital Parks")), [Sequoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_National_Park "Sequoia National Park") and [Yosemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park "Yosemite National Park") in 1890. The [Organic Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service_Organic_Act "National Park Service Organic Act") of 1916 created the National Park Service "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-5) Many current national parks had been previously protected as [national monuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_monument_(United_States) "National monument (United States)") by the president under the [Antiquities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_Act "Antiquities Act") or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is [New River Gorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_River_Gorge_National_Park_and_Preserve "New River Gorge National Park and Preserve"), previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is [National Park of American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_of_American_Samoa "National Park of American Samoa"). A few former national parks are [no longer designated as such](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_in_the_United_States_National_Park_System#Former_national_parks "List of areas in the United States National Park System"), or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") [World Heritage Sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site") (WHS),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-6) and 21 national parks are named UNESCO [Biosphere Reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_the_Biosphere_Programme#Biosphere_reserves "Man and the Biosphere Programme") (BR),[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-biores-7) with eight national parks in both programs.

Thirty states have national parks, as do the [territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States "Territories of the United States") of [American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa "American Samoa") and the [U.S. Virgin Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands "United States Virgin Islands"). The state with the most national parks is [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California") with nine, followed by [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska") with eight, [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah") with five, and [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado") with four. The largest national park is [Wrangell–St. Elias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangell%E2%80%93St._Elias_National_Park_and_Preserve "Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve") in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the [nine smallest states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_area "List of U.S. states and territories by area"). The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is [Gateway Arch National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch_National_Park "Gateway Arch National Park"), [Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri "Missouri"), at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median "Median") of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-acreage_report-8)

The national parks set a visitation record in 2024, with more than 94 million visitors[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-:0-9) [Great Smoky Mountains National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park "Great Smoky Mountains National Park") in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944,[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-10) and had over 12 million visitors in 2024.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-:0-9) In contrast, about 11,900 people visited the remote [Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_the_Arctic_National_Park_and_Preserve "Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve") in Alaska in 2024.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States#cite_note-:0-9)
